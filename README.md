# Data Engine for ZeroSpace

This will be open source soon, I'm just too busy to do the associated work right now, but wanted to show it off to the pkl community :)

This is an unconventional (not that pkl's old enough to have a lot of conventions, perhaps unintentional?) use case.

I'm making a dataset for [the upcoming RTS ZeroSpace](https://playzerospace.com) currently in backer-only Alpha phases, and [our fan site](https://zerospace.gg) to support the community.

I haven't started on bindings and stuff yet, right now i'm rendering to untyped JSON for prototyping that all the data comes out right.

Currently rendering the json with `pkl eval game/game.pkl -f json`
